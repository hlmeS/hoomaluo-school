# Unit 1 - Module 3

## Overview
In the last class, we looked at Pythagorean tuning and introduced the concepts of if-statements and litst. Remember that if-statements are a means to run different code depending on whether a condition is satisfied or not. So far, we've used integers, to check whether values are in certain ranges or equal to certain values, but we can also check other types besides just integers. For example, in the following code block, the user is task to enter a choice and the program then implements different behavior based on the string input.

```python
s = input("Do you want to delete this file? (Y/n) ")

if s == "Y":
  # delete the file
elif s == "n":
  # do nothing
  pass
else :
  # user failed to enter Y or n ... let the user know.
  print("Invalid input. Sorry. Start over.")
```

In this module, we will expand on your knowledge of if-statements, lists, and introduce loops.

## Task
1. We will work through Activity 1.6 together.
2. Based on Activity 1.6, write a program that can output the frequencies of a major or minor scale given a base frequency.
3. Complete the PyCharm course titled `Hoomaluo - Unit 1 - Module 3`.

## Deliverables
Submit your Jupyter notebook with the completed activity 1.6.

## Outcomes
You will continue learning about musical scales. We will introduce a new tuning method that is more commonly used, **equal temperament tuning**. You will get more compfortable working lists and if-statements in Python. We may even start introducing loops.
